## Hi there 👋
- 🧬 I focus on applications of Deep Learning & Artificial intelligence in science (Chemistry, Biology, Physic, Mathematics)
- Current Status: Working at [MAMA AI](https://themama.ai/)
- This is my personal profile (i am active mainly on my company github profile); contact me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/miroslav-lžičař-1b8842b4) 

### Interests 🤩
- Current Projects:
    - [CHEESE](https://cheese.themama.ai/) with documentation at [CHEESE-DOCS](https://cheese-docs.themama.ai/). – An ultra-fast AI molecular search over billion-scale molecular databases. Allows for 3D-Shape, Electrostatic and possibly any other trainable metric too.
- 🔭 My current research interests are:
    - Deep Metric Learning & Isometric Embeddings Theory
    - Chemoinformatics (molecular similarity, protein-ligand interactions)
    - Vector Databases
- 🦘 I am now also somewhat involved in or interested at:
    - Metric Learning
    - Graph Neural Networks
    - Reinforcement Learning
    - Random Network Distillation (e.g. Curiosity driven learning)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
    - Repositories & Papers matching my interests
    - Exploratory analysis and implementation of machine learning papers
    - Kaggle competitions
    - OpenSource
- 💬 I’m currently working on more intereseting projects, papers and private repositories that will be soon published
- ⚡ Fun fact: Former student of [Philosophy at Charles (ÚFAR)](https://ufar.ff.cuni.cz/en/department-2/)
