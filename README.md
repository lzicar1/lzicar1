## Hi there üëã
- üß¨ I focus on applications of Deep Learning & Artificial intelligence in science (Chemistry, Biology, Physic, Mathematics)
- Current Status:
  - Working at [MAMA AI](https://themama.ai/)
  - Open for collaboration! (both academic, opensource or commercial)
- This is my personal profile (i am active mainly on my company github profile); contact me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/miroslav-l≈æiƒça≈ô-1b8842b4)!

### Interests
- Current Projects:
    - [CHEESE](https://cheese.themama.ai/) with documentation at [CHEESE-DOCS](https://cheese-docs.themama.ai/). ‚Äì An ultra-fast AI molecular search over billion-scale molecular databases. Allows for 3D-Shape, Electrostatic and possibly any other trainable metric too.
- üî≠ My current research interests are:
    - Deep Metric Learning &¬†Isometric Embeddings Theory
    - Chemoinformatics (molecular similarity,¬†protein-ligand interactions)
    - Attention Transformers
    - Vector Databases
- ü¶ò I am also somewhat involved in or interested at:
    - Reinforcement Learning
- üí¨ I‚Äôm currently working on more interesting projects, papers and private repositories that will be soon published
- ‚ö° Fun fact: Prior to [Bioinformatics](https://bioinformatika.mff.cuni.cz/program/index.en.html) at [Charles University Prague](https://cuni.cz/UKEN-1.html) I studied [Philosophy at Charles (√öFAR)](https://ufar.ff.cuni.cz/en/department-2/)

### Public projects on Github üé¨ 
- (coming soon) [CHEESE API](https://cheese-docs.themama.ai/) ‚Äì A public API for CHEESE.
- [Spanning trees search](https://github.com/lzicar1/Spanning-trees-search) ‚Äì Library for computation and visualisation of spanning trees. (Homework for school)
- [Particle Swarm Optimization](https://github.com/lzicar1/Particle-Swarm-Optimization) ‚Äì C# repository for optimizing function via particle swarm optimization (Homework for school)
- [Time resolved X-ray diffraction crystallography](https://github.com/lzicar1/Time-resolved-X-ray-diffraction-crystallography) ‚Äì Work for ELI Beamlines under research group TREX at Department of Structural Dynamics
- [EigerRequests](https://github.com/lzicar1/EigerRequests) ‚Äì A repository implementing example Python http requests for [DECTRIS EIGER DETECTOR](https://www.dectris.com/detectors/x-ray-detectors/)
- (coming soon) [Adamator](https://github.com/UKUK-Repository-Dept/adamator-geobibline) ‚Äì A comprehensive library for metadata parsing from MARC21 to XML and creating DSPACE packages on remotely server
- (coming soon) [Empanada](https://github.com/UKUK-Repository-Dept/empanada) ‚Äì Flask application for processing digitalization requests of students with special needs for [Carolina centre at Charles University](https://centrumcarolina.cuni.cz/CCENG-1.html)
